      <h3>please read before filling out booking form:</h3>
      <p>if you like any of the pieces on my <a href="./flash.html">flash</a> you can request them on the form. some will have size minimums to ensure quality and detail. if you aren't sure about placement, i can make recommendations or tell you what to do. i'm a girl with a lot of ideas, strong opinions, and good taste. you can also request edits on flash pieces. i would love to work with you to design something that feels exciting to both of us, whether that's editing a flash piece or creating something new. if you just have a generalized desire for some new ink and possess a secure, transfeminist relationship to <em>The Body</em>, you can also select the <em>Freedom</em> option (free of charge) in which i tattoo whatever i want on you and you don't get to see it until after. for all other appointments, i will recommend a price that i think is appropriate. that being said, all tattoos are no judgement pay-what-you-can. tattoos are unaffordable, the world is cruel, and art should be free. i love tattooing and i have money so really please take advantage of this. trades more than welcome too. since i only do handpoke, medium to large pieces will likely take more than one session. i will give you a time and session # estimate but i could be wrong. sorry not sorry. let me know if you have any questions.</p>
