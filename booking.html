      <h3>please read before filling out booking form:</h3>
      <p>if you like any of the pieces on my <a href="./flash.html">flash</a> you can request them on the form. some will have size minimums to ensure quality and detail. if you aren't sure about placement, i can make recommendations or tell you what to do. i'm a girl with a lot of ideas, strong opinions, and good taste. you can also request edits on flash pieces. i love to work together to design something that feels exciting to both of us. if you have an idea of your own i'd also love to work with you to make that come alive. if you just want a tattoo and have a secure, transfeminist relationship to the body, you can also select the <em>Freedom</em> option (free of charge) in which i tattoo whatever i want on you and you don't get to see it until after. for all client appointments aside from <em>Freedom</em> plan beneficiaries, i will recommend a price point. that being said, all tattoos are no judgement pay-what-you-can. tattoos are expensive, the world is cruel, and art should be free. i love tattooing and i have money so really please take advantage of this. since i only do handpoke, medium to large pieces will likely take more than one session. </p>
